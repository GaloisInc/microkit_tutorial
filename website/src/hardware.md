# (Optional) Running on hardware

Optionally, you can complete the workshop using real hardware instead of a simulator. The workshop has support for the following boards:
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
<!-- * Raspberry Pi 4 Model B+ -->

If you have one of these boards and would like to complete the workshop using it, you will need the following:
* A microSD card to boot the system image from. You will need to be able to access this microSD card from your computer, to transfer any built system images to it.
* A way to transmit and receive characters via the UART, connecting to the GPIO pins. One way is to use a <a href="https://www.jaycar.com.au/medias/sys_master/images/images/9677407715358/XC4464-arduino-compatible-usb-to-serial-adaptor-moduleImageMain-900.jpg" target="_blank">USB to serial adapter</a>.
* A power supply for the board you are using. Note that since the workshop is in Munich, expect the power socket type to be European.

After acquiring the listed parts, have a look at the setup instructions for your board:
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](./rpi3b.md)
<!-- * [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B+](./rpi4b.md) -->
